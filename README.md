# Market Basket Analysis

## Project Description

Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique used to identify associations or patterns in transactional data, such as those from a retail environment. This technique helps in understanding the purchase behavior of customers by finding relationships between the items they buy.

This project involves performing Market Basket Analysis using a dataset of retail transactions. The main objective is to uncover associations between products bought together by customers. This information can be useful for cross-selling strategies, inventory management, and improving customer satisfaction.

## Key Steps in the Analysis

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:
    - Load the dataset, clean it by removing unnecessary columns and handling missing values, and preprocess invoice numbers.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Display summary statistics of the dataset.
    - Analyze the distribution of transactions across different countries.

3. **Data Transformation**:
    - Create a basket format of transactions for a specific country (Germany in this case).
    - Convert the data into a one-hot encoded format suitable for analysis.

4. **Association Rule Mining**:
    - Apply the Apriori algorithm to identify frequent itemsets.
    - Generate association rules from these itemsets.
    - Filter rules based on support, confidence, and lift metrics.

5. **Visualization**:
    - Plot various visualizations to interpret the association rules and frequent itemsets.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn mlxtend
    ```
3. Open the `Market Basket Analysis.ipynb` notebook.
4. Run the notebook cells to see the analysis steps and results.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is a collection of retail transactions. Each row represents an individual transaction, and the columns include details such as the invoice number, product description, quantity, and country.

## Results

The project successfully identifies frequent itemsets and association rules that reveal interesting patterns in the transaction data. These insights can be leveraged to improve retail strategies and customer experience.
